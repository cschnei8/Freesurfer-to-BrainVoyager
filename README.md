# Freesurfer-to-BrainVoyager
Scripts to convert Freesurfer output to BrainVoyager file formats. Main script is fsSurf2BV from Jens Schwarzbach.

12/18/16: Currently working on additional functionality to also import/create volumetric regions of interest from the Freesurfer parcellation. Output for this will be in .voi files.
